## Conclusions
### Charged Off
- It is observed  that irrespective of loan amount, the customer is more likely to default if the interest rate is higher.
- Customers are more likely to default whose debt to income ratio is more than 25 or the loan amount is more than 25000(Irrespective of DTI value). Lending club should consider DTI metric to be less than 25 while issuing the loans.
- Grades and sub-grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. B grade loans have highest probability of defaulting followed by grades C and D. Sub-grades B5, B3 and C1 have highest probability of defaulting.
- Lending Club should consider giving lesser loan amount for customers with 2 bankruptcy public records. It has been observed that almost all the customers with 2 bankruptcy cases have defaulted and their median loan amount has been around 13000.
- To predict any upcoming default, lending company can use below indicators:
    - Customers has made 8 inquiries and has a loan amount greater than 15000.
    - Customer has 2 bankruptcy records and has a loan amount greater than 10000.

### Fully Paid
- A4, A5 and B3 sub grade loans have highest probability of being fully paid off. So, lending club can consider issuing more of these.
- Looking at the data it is strongly evident that any customer with more than 2 public records will not default irrespective of the loan amount. Lending club can use this information to grant loans with confidence.
